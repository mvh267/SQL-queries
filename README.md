# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database: SQL Challenge #
## Project Overview ##
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first major task was to reconstruct and analyze the company's employee database from the 1980s and 1990s, using six CSV files. This project was divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling ##
- ERD Creation: Inspected the CSV files and sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database structure.
- Database Design: Identified key relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys to establish the integrity of the database.
## Data Engineering ##
- Table Schema Design: Developed a table schema for each CSV file, ensuring proper data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Database Implementation: Created the tables in SQL with the correct order and hierarchy to accommodate foreign key relationships.
- Data Importation: Successfully imported each CSV file into its corresponding table in the SQL database.
## Data Analysis ##
Conducted thorough SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the database, including:

- Employee Details: Retrieved employee numbers, names, sexes, and salaries.
- 1986 Hires: Listed names and hire dates of employees who were hired in 1986.
- Department Managers: Identified managers for each department.
- Employee Departments: Listed department details for each employee.
- Named Employees: Found employees named Hercules with last names starting with 'B'.
- Sales Department Employees: Listed all employees in the Sales department.
- Sales & Development Departments: Compiled details of employees in both Sales and Development.
- Last Name Frequency: Analyzed the frequency of employee last names.
## Key Skills Demonstrated ##
- Proficient in SQL for database creation, data insertion, and complex querying.
- Skilled in data modeling and understanding of relational database concepts.
- Effective in data analysis and interpretation of complex datasets.
## Repository Management ##
- Managed project files and documentation within the 'sql-challenge' repository.
- Maintained high standards of organization and documentation for easy reference and reproducibility.
