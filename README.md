# Pewlett Hackard SQL Challenge Summary #
## Overview ##
In this project, as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, I took on the challenge of reconstructing the company's employee database from the 1980s and 1990s. The task involved data modeling, engineering, and analysis using six legacy CSV files.

## Key Accomplishments ##
## Data Modeling ##
- ERD Development: Inspected CSV files and created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database schema.
- Database Structure: Defined table relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and relational database design.
## Data Engineering ##
- Schema Design: Crafted table schemas for each of the six CSV files, specifying appropriate data types, constraints, and keys.
- Database Creation: Executed SQL commands to create tables in the correct sequence, accounting for dependencies due to foreign keys.
- Data Importation: Successfully imported data from CSV files into the SQL database, adhering to the schema requirements.
## Data Analysis ##
- Conducted comprehensive SQL queries to extract and analyze employee data, focusing on:
  - Employee details (numbers, names, sexes, salaries).
  - Employees hired in 1986.
  - Managers for each department.
  - Department details for all employees.
  - Employees with specific name criteria.
  - Personnel in the Sales, and Sales & Development departments.
  - Frequency counts of employee last names.
## Technical Proficiency ##
- Demonstrated expertise in SQL for data manipulation and querying.
- Applied data analysis skills to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.
- Utilized data modeling tools for effective database design.
## Project Management ##
- Efficiently managed and documented the project in the 'sql-challenge' GitHub repository.
- Ensured clear, organized, and well-commented code for future reference and collaboration.
